        <b>The life of Chanakya</b>
        He was born into a Brahman family and received his education at <b>Taxila</b> (now in Pakistan). He is known to have had a knowledge of medicine and astrology, 
        and it is believed he was familiar with elements of Greek and Persian learning introduced into India by Zoroastrians. Some authorities believe he was a 
        Zoroastrian or at least was strongly influenced by that religion.

    <p style="text-align:center"><b>Chanakya</b> (Sanskrit: चाणक्य) was an ancient Indian polymath who was active as a teacher, author, strategist,
         philosopher, economist, jurist, and royal advisor. He is traditionally identified as Kauṭilya or Vishnugupta, who authored the ancient
          Indian political treatise, the Arthashastra, a text dated to roughly between the fourth century BCE and the third century CE.
          As such, he is considered the pioneer of the field of political science and economics in India, and his work is thought of as an important
           precursor to classical economics. His works were lost near the end of the Gupta Empire in the sixth century CE and not rediscovered until
            the early 20th century.

        <p style="text-align:center">Around 321 BCE, <b>Chanakya</b> assisted the first Mauryan emperor <b>Chandragupta</b> in his rise to power and is widely credited for having played
             an important role in the establishment of the Maurya Empire. Chanakya served as the <b>chief advisor </b>to both emperors Chandragupta and his son 
             Bindusara.</p>
